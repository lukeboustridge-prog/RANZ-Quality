## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent v1.2 design decisions:

- Programme enrolment as Phase 13 (foundation - "all in or not" approach)
- Micro-credentials Phase 14 builds on existing personnel/staff management
- Team composition Phase 15 uses micro-credential data for qualification tracking
- Client checklists Phase 16 integrates with existing Project Evidence system

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Tech Debt (carried from v1.0):**
- CRON_SECRET validated at runtime only, not build-time (medium severity)

**External Dependencies (not blockers):**
- Clerk JWT template configuration (manual Dashboard step)
- DNS CNAME for production SSO
- Roofing Reports satellite app configuration
- RoofWright micro-credential definitions need alignment with training provider (can build catalogue structure first)

**v1.2 Readiness:**
- All 25 requirements mapped to phases 13-16
- Success criteria derived for all phases
- 100% requirement coverage validated
- Phase dependencies identified
