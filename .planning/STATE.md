## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: compliance-v2.ts selected as canonical scoring engine (four-dimension breakdown, issue tracking)
- All phases: Depth=comprehensive (8 phases) to address MVP gaps before Q2 2026 pilot launch

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**From codebase analysis (CONCERNS.md):**
- Phase 1 addresses: Duplicate compliance scoring causing inconsistencies, hardcoded thresholds
- Phase 2 addresses: Dashboard shows false positive indicators, score doesn't recalculate on changes
- Phase 3 addresses: Unsecured cron endpoints, missing audit trail implementation
- Phase 4 addresses: Public API enumeration risk, no file size validation
- Phase 5-6 address: SMS notifications configured but not called, wrong recipient targeting
- Phase 7 addresses: Report generation stubbed with TODO comments
- Phase 8 addresses: SSO satellite domain not configured

**Critical for pilot launch:**
All 8 phases must complete before onboarding 10-30 pilot members in Q2 2026.
