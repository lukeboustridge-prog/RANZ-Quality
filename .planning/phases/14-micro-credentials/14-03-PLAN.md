<objective>
Enable staff to upload certificate evidence against awarded credentials, add credential expiry notifications to the cron system, and provide RANZ admin with a coverage report across all organisations.

Purpose: This completes the micro-credential feature set. Evidence upload gives staff a place to store their certificate files. Expiry notifications ensure credentials don't silently lapse. The coverage report gives RANZ visibility into the programme's adoption and workforce qualification levels across the membership.

Output: Evidence upload API + UI, cron expiry checks, admin coverage report.

  <name>Task 1: Certificate evidence upload API and credentials page upload UI</name>
  <files>
    src/app/api/credentials/[id]/evidence/route.ts
    src/app/(dashboard)/credentials/page.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    1. Create src/app/api/credentials/[id]/evidence/route.ts:
       - The [id] param is the StaffMicroCredential ID (NOT the definition ID)
       - POST endpoint requiring Clerk auth with orgId
       - Validate the StaffMicroCredential exists and belongs to a member in the caller's organization:
         ```typescript
         const credential = await db.staffMicroCredential.findUnique({
           where: { id: params.id },
           include: {
             member: { include: { organization: true } },
             definition: true,
           },
         });
         // Verify credential.member.organization.clerkOrgId === caller's orgId
         ```
       - Only allow upload if credential status is AWARDED (return 400 otherwise with message "Can only upload evidence for awarded credentials")
       - Accept multipart/form-data with a single file field "file"
       - Validate file: max 50MB (use MAX_FILE_SIZE_BYTES from @/types), allowed mimeTypes: application/pdf, image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp
       - Upload to R2 using uploadToR2 from @/lib/r2 with key: `credentials/${credential.member.organizationId}/${credential.memberId}/${credential.id}/${Date.now()}-${fileName}`
       - Update StaffMicroCredential record:
         ```
         certificateKey: storageKey (returned from uploadToR2)
         certificateFileName: original file name
         certificateUploadedAt: new Date()
         certificateUploadedBy: userId (from Clerk auth)
         ```
       - Return 200 with { success: true, fileName, storageKey }

    2. Update src/app/(dashboard)/credentials/page.tsx to add evidence upload capability:
       - This page was created as a Server Component in Plan 02. It needs to become a hybrid: keep the server data fetch but add a Client Component for the upload interaction.
       - Create the page as a Server Component that passes data to a Client Component:
         - Server Component (page.tsx) fetches data as before
         - Extract the credential list rendering into a client component `CredentialsList` (can be inline or a separate file -- inline is fine for this scope, wrap the interactive part in a "use client" component)
         - The simplest approach: Make the ENTIRE page "use client" and fetch data with useEffect (consistent with how admin pages work). Refactor from Plan 02's server component to client component.
         - OR: Keep server component and use a thin client wrapper for the upload button only. Given the upload is per-credential-row, use the client wrapper approach:
           - Add an "Upload Certificate" button next to each AWARDED credential that has no certificate yet
           - Add a "View Certificate" link for credentials that already have a certificate uploaded
           - The upload button opens a file input (hidden input triggered by button click)
           - On file select: POST to /api/credentials/[id]/evidence with FormData
           - Show upload progress/success/error state
         - DECISION: Convert the page to "use client" for simplicity. The data volume is small (staff + credentials) and client-side fetching matches the admin page patterns.
         - Refactor: Make page.tsx "use client", fetch org credentials from a new API endpoint GET /api/credentials (or use inline fetch to an existing endpoint).
       - Add to each AWARDED credential item:
         - If no certificate: "Upload Certificate" button (lucide Upload icon). On click, open file picker. On file selected, upload via fetch POST with FormData to /api/credentials/{staffCredentialId}/evidence. Show loading spinner during upload. On success, refresh data and show the file name.
         - If certificate exists: Show file name as a link/text with a CheckCircle icon indicating evidence attached. Show "Replace" button to upload a new file (same flow, overwrites).
       - Also add GET /api/credentials/route.ts if it doesn't exist yet (Plan 02 may have created it, or the server component may have used direct Prisma). Create it:
         - GET requires Clerk auth with orgId
         - Returns organization members with their microCredentials (same query as Plan 02's server component but as API)
         - Group by member for easy consumption

  </action>
  <verify>
    Run `pnpm typecheck` passes.
    Navigate to /credentials -- page renders with credential list.
    For an AWARDED credential, click "Upload Certificate" -- file picker opens.
    Upload a PDF -- file stored in R2, credential record updated, UI shows file name with check icon.
    Attempt to upload for a non-AWARDED credential -- blocked with appropriate message.
    Upload a replacement certificate -- previous key overwritten in record (R2 file remains, old key replaced).
  </verify>
  <done>
    Staff/org admin can upload certificate evidence (PDF, JPEG, PNG, WebP up to 50MB) for AWARDED credentials.
    Uploaded certificates stored in R2 under credentials/{orgId}/{memberId}/{credId}/ path.
    Credential record updated with storage key, filename, upload timestamp, and uploader ID.
    UI shows upload button for AWARDED credentials without evidence, file name for those with evidence.
    Non-AWARDED credentials cannot have evidence uploaded (400 error).

    1. Update src/app/api/cron/notifications/route.ts:
       - Add `credentialExpiries: 0` to the results object
       - Add step 9: `results.credentialExpiries = await checkCredentialExpiries();`
       - Create the checkCredentialExpiries function following the EXACT same pattern as checkProgrammeRenewals (cumulative threshold checks):

       ```typescript
       async function checkCredentialExpiries(): Promise<number> {
         const now = new Date();
         const in90Days = new Date(now.getTime() + 90 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
         let alertsSent = 0;

         // Get AWARDED credentials with expiry dates within 90 days
         const expiringCredentials = await db.staffMicroCredential.findMany({
           where: {
             status: "AWARDED",
             expiryDate: { lte: in90Days, gt: now },
           },
           include: {
             definition: true,
             member: {
               include: {
                 organization: {
                   select: { id: true, name: true, email: true },
                 },
               },
             },
           },
         });

         for (const credential of expiringCredentials) {
           if (!credential.expiryDate) continue;

           const daysUntilExpiry = Math.ceil(
             (credential.expiryDate.getTime() - now.getTime()) / (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
           );

           // Determine which alerts to send (cumulative thresholds)
           const alertsToSend: { days: number; flag: "expiryAlert90Sent" | "expiryAlert60Sent" | "expiryAlert30Sent" }[] = [];

           if (daysUntilExpiry <= 90 && !credential.expiryAlert90Sent) {
             alertsToSend.push({ days: 90, flag: "expiryAlert90Sent" });
           }
           if (daysUntilExpiry <= 60 && !credential.expiryAlert60Sent) {
             alertsToSend.push({ days: 60, flag: "expiryAlert60Sent" });
           }
           if (daysUntilExpiry <= 30 && !credential.expiryAlert30Sent) {
             alertsToSend.push({ days: 30, flag: "expiryAlert30Sent" });
           }

           if (alertsToSend.length === 0) continue;

           const staffName = `${credential.member.firstName} ${credential.member.lastName}`;
           const formattedDate = credential.expiryDate.toLocaleDateString("en-NZ", {
             day: "numeric", month: "long", year: "numeric",
           });

           try {
             await db.$transaction(async (tx) => {

         return alertsSent;
       }
       ```

       - Import createNotification from @/lib/notifications if not already imported (it already is).
       - NOTE: Do NOT auto-transition status to EXPIRED. The cron only sends notifications. Status transitions to EXPIRED are handled manually by RANZ admin or could be added as a separate concern later.

    2. Create src/app/api/admin/micro-credentials/report/route.ts:
       - GET endpoint requiring ranz:admin role
       - Query aggregated data: for each organization, count total staff, total credentials assigned, credentials by status, and credential coverage percentage
       - Query approach:
         ```typescript
         const organizations = await db.organization.findMany({
           select: {
             id: true,
             name: true,
             tradingName: true,
             certificationTier: true,
             members: {
               select: {
                 id: true,
                 firstName: true,
                 lastName: true,
                 microCredentials: {
                   select: {
                     id: true,
                     status: true,
                     definition: { select: { title: true } },
                   },
                 },
               },
             },
           },
           orderBy: { name: "asc" },
         });
         ```
       - Transform into report format:
         ```
         {
           summary: {
             totalOrganizations: number,
             totalStaff: number,
             totalCredentialsAssigned: number,
             totalCredentialsAwarded: number,
             overallCoveragePercent: number  // (orgs with at least 1 awarded / total orgs) * 100
           },
           organizations: [
             {
               id, name, tradingName, certificationTier,
               staffCount: number,
               credentialsAssigned: number,
               credentialsAwarded: number,
               credentialsByStatus: { NOT_STARTED: n, IN_TRAINING: n, ASSESSMENT_PENDING: n, AWARDED: n, EXPIRED: n },
               coveragePercent: number  // (staff with at least 1 awarded / total staff) * 100
             }
           ]
         }
         ```
       - Return 200 with the report data

    3. Update src/app/(admin)/admin/micro-credentials/page.tsx:
       - Add a "Coverage Report" tab or section below the definitions table
       - Add a toggle or tab: "Definitions" | "Coverage Report"
       - When "Coverage Report" is active:
         - Fetch from GET /api/admin/micro-credentials/report
         - Show summary cards at top: Total Organisations, Total Staff, Credentials Assigned, Credentials Awarded, Overall Coverage %
         - Show per-organisation table: Org Name, Tier badge, Staff Count, Assigned, Awarded, Coverage %, status breakdown mini-bars or text
         - Sort by coverage % descending (orgs with best coverage first)
         - Use a simple horizontal bar or colored text for status breakdown (e.g., "3 Awarded, 2 In Training, 1 Not Started")
       - Keep the existing definitions list as the default view
       - Use a simple state toggle (useState with "definitions" | "report") and conditional rendering
       - Add lucide-react icons: BarChart3 for report tab
