This could result in unescaped rendering when developers pass user-controlled strings directly as children, or when fallbackRender returns user-controlled strings (for example, reflecting error messages that contain attacker input).\n\nThis vulnerability is only exploitable when an application renders untrusted user input within `ErrorBoundary` without appropriate escaping or sanitization.\n\n## Impact\n\nSuccessful exploitation may allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim’s browser (reflected XSS).

The middleware does not respect standard cache control headers such as `Cache-Control: private` or `Cache-Control: no-store`, which may result in private or authenticated responses being cached and subsequently exposed to unauthorized users.\n\n## Details\n\nThe vulnerability exists in the cache decision logic of Cache Middleware. When determining whether a response should be cached, the middleware does not take HTTP cache control semantics into account and may cache responses that are explicitly marked as private by the application. While some runtimes, such as Cloudflare Workers, enforce cache control restrictions at the platform level, other runtimes including Deno, Bun, and Node.js rely on the middleware’s behavior. As a result, applications running on these runtimes may unintentionally cache sensitive responses.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis issue can lead to Web Cache Deception and information disclosure. If an authenticated user accesses an endpoint that returns user-specific or sensitive data and the response is cached despite being marked as private, subsequent unauthenticated requests may receive the cached response. This may result in the exposure of personally identifiable information or session-related data. The impact is limited to applications that use the hono/cache middleware and rely on it to correctly honor HTTP cache control directives.\n\n## Affected Components\n\n* Cache Middleware",

      "overview": "## Summary\n\nIP Restriction Middleware in Hono is vulnerable to an IP address validation bypass. The `IPV4_REGEX` pattern and `convertIPv4ToBinary` function in `src/utils/ipaddr.ts` do not properly validate that IPv4 octet values are within the valid range of 0-255, allowing attackers to craft malformed IP addresses that bypass IP-based access controls.\n\n## Details\n\nThe vulnerability exists in two components:\n\n1. **Permissive regex pattern:** The `IPV4_REGEX (/^[0-9]{0,3}\\.[0-9]{0,3}\\.[0-9]{0,3}\\.[0-9]{0,3}$/)` accepts octet values greater than 255 (e.g., `999`).\n2. **Unsafe binary conversion:** The `convertIPv4ToBinary` function does not validate octet ranges before performing bitwise operations. When an octet exceeds 255, it overflows into adjacent octets during the bit-shift calculation.\n\nFor example, the IP address `1.2.2.355` is accepted and converts to the same binary value as 1.2.3.99:\n\n* `355` = `256 + 99` = `0x163`\n* After bit-shifting: `(1 << 24) + (2 << 16) + (2 << 8) + 355` = `0x01020363` = `1.2.3.99`\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can bypass IP-based restrictions by crafting malformed IP addresses:\n\n* **Blocklist bypass:** If `1.2.3.0/24` is blocked, an attacker can use `1.2.2.355` (or similar) to bypass the restriction.\n* **Allowlist bypass:** Requests from unauthorized IP ranges may be incorrectly permitted.\n\nThis is exploitable when the application relies on client-provided IP addresses (e.g., `X-Forwarded-For header`) for access control decisions.\n\n## Affected Components\n\n* IP Restriction Middleware\n* `src/utils/ipaddr.ts`: `IPV4_REGEX`, `convertIPv4ToBinary`, `distinctRemoteAddr`",
